ey people, %AUTHOR_NAME% here with a special announcement. It's my privilege to tell you that the new <i>From the Vault</i> set is coming and all I can say is WHOA NELLY Wizards, you outdid yourselves again! Let me be honest with you, this is quite possibly the sweetest, sickest, jaw-droppingest collectable Magic product I've had the privilege to lay my eyeballs on. Trust me, you've NEVER seen anything like this before. Not. Even. Close.
<br/><br/>
What's in the box? Just fifteen of the most REDONKULOUS cards ever to be laid on cardboard, all of them in BLING BLING super premium collectable foil. How amazing are they? Let's just say that WotC doesn't just pick fifteen cards out of a hat, foil them up, and stick em in a box with a $35 price tag on the front. No sir, these cards are just ... Wow.
<br/><br/>
You can buy <i>%SET_TITLE%</i> starting on %RELEASE_DATE%. It's yours for the low low MSRP price of $34.99. Well done again Wizards, I tip my hat to you!
