<CENTER>Pro MTG Online is the ultimate Magic strategy web site. It covers the latest in Magic: The Gathering news as well as unrelated news from around the world. It also contains key strategy, tactics, plans, suggestions, advice, and recommendations!<BR><BR>
This site was freely willed into existence by an automatic agent. How can this be harmonized? The answer to this question is yet another: What is a man, but the final summation of his causes? This is Deterministic Compatibilism.<BR><BR>
<B>Pro MTG Online is drawn in MSPaint, and uses Arial 8 pt bold.</B><BR><BR>
