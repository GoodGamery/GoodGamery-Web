<font color=#FFFFFF>PMO feedback: True story! I was playing at regionals against GR. I played Hierarch and he looks at his hand and he's like "ok." THen he goes "oh... er.. on second thought, I'll" and I totally stopped him and was like "naw you said ok bro." And that is how you deal with Flames of the Blood Hand. The End.</font></font>
